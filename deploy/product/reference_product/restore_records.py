"""The merchant's records a service restore asks for, from the product's ledger.

After the service is restored from backup, its operator asks every merchant for what it did or
received after the restore point (deploy/runbooks/restore.md, step 2). `export_restore_records`
answers with the product's own records, each already in the body of the admin request that brings
it back, without the operator's `reason`:

- `treasuries`: `POST /v1/admin/restore/treasuries/verify` bodies (step 3) of at most 100
  treasuries each, per mode: each treasury's latest object among the `treasury.*` deliveries the
  webhook inbox kept;
- `treasury_applications`: `POST /v1/admin/restore/treasuries/apply` bodies (step 3), one per
  kept delivery of a `treasury.updated` that announced a pending change becoming `active`, the
  only evidence a lost application is restored from;
- `deposit_addresses`: `POST /v1/admin/restore/deposit_addresses` bodies (step 4), from each
  deposit address response the product recorded, with its `client_secret`;
- `quotes`: `POST /v1/admin/restore/quotes` bodies (step 4), from each quote response the product
  recorded, with its `client_secret`;
- `events`: `POST /v1/admin/restore/events` bodies (step 5) of at most 100 deliveries each, every
  `deposit.credited`, `deposit.rejected`, and `deposit.reversed` delivery the webhook inbox kept,
  its raw body and Standard Webhooks headers exactly as received, in the order of their deposits'
  receipt positions and revisions, so a reversed deposit comes right before the one that replaced
  it.

With `since` (the restore point, Unix seconds), a record is exported when the service created it
or the product last recorded it (a deposit address posted again gets a fresh `client_secret`) at
most `SINCE_MARGIN` seconds before: the service re-issues a quote it no longer holds that was
created up to five minutes before the restore point. Without `since`, everything is exported,
which is safe: a record the restored service still holds is answered `reissued: false` or
`matches`. The export holds client secrets:
hand it to the operator over the incident's channel only, and delete it once the restore is done.
