"""The webhook receiver and fulfillment: the product side of `deposit.*` events.

The service credits a deposit once it is priced and screened, and tells the product with a signed
`deposit.credited` webhook. `Fulfillment` does what Phala Cloud's backend does with it:

1. verify the Standard Webhooks `v1a` signature against the account's webhook keys pinned from
   attestation, over the raw body, and that the event names the product's account and mode;
2. credit once per deposit: the order row keyed by `provider_order_id`, the deposit's `dep_` id,
   is found-or-created under a unique index, and the credit transaction and
   `complete_order_payment` commit in the same transaction;
3. hold instead of crediting when the product refuses (unknown or suspended workspace, its own
   per-deposit or per-period cap); support later collects a refund address and requests a refund;
4. answer `2xx` only after that commit, so a failure is retried by the service.

Every verified delivery is kept once, by its `webhook-id`, in the ledger's webhook inbox: its raw
body and Standard Webhooks headers as received, in the same transaction as its ledger effect. A
redelivery changes nothing; one with another body (only a service restored from backup sends one)
keeps the first and is logged for the operator. The kept deliveries are the evidence a service
restore imports (reference_product.restore_records).

`deposit.refunded` and `deposit.reversed` take a credit back. Every `deposit.*` event carries the
whole deposit with cumulative, service-computed claw-backs (`amount_refunded`, the refunded share
of the credit; `amount_reversed`, all of it once reversed), and events may arrive in any order, so
the balance follows the snapshots, not the event types: per deposit, in one transaction, the stored
view and the snapshot merge (the later status and the larger claw-backs win), and a credited order
is adjusted to what its credit nets to, `credit - amount_refunded - amount_reversed`. A
`deposit.reversed` that arrives before `deposit.credited` leaves nothing to credit. Every other
event type is stored for notifications and history; none moves a balance.

A promotion is the product's own logic, not Phala Pay's: with `bonus_bps` set for the deposit's
asset (`{"pha": 1000}`), an accepted credit also earns a bonus line of `credit * bps / 10_000`
cents, rounded down, fixed on the order when it is credited. It follows the same snapshots: a
deposit's bonus is always `net * bps / 10_000` of what its credit nets to, so a refund takes back
its share of the bonus and a reversal or full refund all of it, and a replayed event changes
nothing.
