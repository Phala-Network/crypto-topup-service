"""Sandbox smoke check: the calls a product makes against a Phala Pay service, with their checks.

These are the calls a product such as Phala Cloud makes, and the checks it adds to each:

1. pin the account's webhook keys from attestation evidence bound to a fresh nonce, fetched with
   the account's API key;
2. create a quote (the account is created with it); the client recomputes its single-use address
   from the pinned forwarder;
3. list the account's deposits;
4. receive webhooks (Standard Webhooks) and fulfill each `deposit.credited` once.

The handler of step 4 goes behind the product's webhook URL. It stops where the SDK stops: the
product commits the credit, keyed by `credit.fulfillment_key` under a unique index, before
answering `2xx`. deploy/product/reference_product is a complete product that does all of it.

Run steps 1-3 against the sandbox (deploy/sandbox/README.md):

    uv run --locked --project sdk/python python deploy/sandbox/smoke.py \\
        --config sandbox.json
