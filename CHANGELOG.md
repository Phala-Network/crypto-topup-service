# Changelog

Integrator-visible changes to the HTTP API and webhook payloads. Additive fields are not breaking;
webhook receivers must ignore unknown fields.

## Unreleased

### Webhooks

- `deposit.credited` and `deposit.rejected` payloads now include `chain_id`, `state`
  (`credited` or `rejected`), and `route` (null when no route was selected); `chain_id` and
  `route` match the fields already on `deposit.confirmed`. This covers every producer, including
  the scanner's `unsupported_asset` rejection. The change is additive; existing fields are
  unchanged. See `docs/architecture.md` §12.

### Rate locks

- A lock now expires by chain time: `rate_lock.expired` is emitted only once the finalized chain
  has passed `expires_at` and no payment mined inside the window awaits confirmation, so a payment
  made in the last minutes of the window is consumed at the lock price and never reported as
  expired. Until then `GET …/rate-locks/{ref}` returns `status: open` with
  `remaining_seconds: 0`; expiry events arrive about 15 minutes after `expires_at`. See
  `docs/architecture.md` §9.
